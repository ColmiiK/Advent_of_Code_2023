I used my own `libft` library that I created in my first project in **42 MÃ¡laga** for this puzzle. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ColmiiK/libft)

## How did it go?
I had a harder time with this puzzle, specially getting the parsing of the numbers correct. Some pointer arithmetic (something I'm not really used to doing) really helped for the `strstr` functions.

Thankfully the second puzzle was way easier than expected.
