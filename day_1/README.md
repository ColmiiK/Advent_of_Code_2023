# --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

You can read about this puzzle and many more on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1). I also included my own input in the `input.txt` file.

## How to use

```
git clone 
```

I used my own `libft` library that I created in my first project in **42 Málaga** for this puzzle. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ColmiiK/libft)
### This solution is kinda janky, but it works ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
